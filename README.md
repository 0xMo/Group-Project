# Group Project
A Vulnerable Website! The project is built from the ground up as an intentionally insecure web application. It is intended for use in security training for students to practice and gain an awareness of web based security vulnerablitites.

## Setup
The application is built entirely in node.js and we would love you to test it out and give us some feedback! Simply follow the instuctions bellow to get the application up and running, feel free to raise any issues or make pull requests with your suggestions!

### From Sources

1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/sam-grierson/Group-Project.git` (or clone [your own fork](https://github.com/sam-grierson/Group-Project/fork) of the repository)
3. Go into the cloned folder using your choice of command line
4. Run `npm install` (This installs the dependancies and only needs to be done when you first start or have changed the source code)
5. Run `npm start`
6. Browse to <http://localhost:3000>

### Updating or Changing the Code

Since this version is currently in development it has some development dependancies such as nodemon to make changing the source code easier. To make your life easier use the development startup script `npm run devStart` when making edits to the code. This will rehost the application to <http://localhost:3000> everytime the source code files are changed and saved.
